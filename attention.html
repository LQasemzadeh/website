      <h3>Attention</h3>
      <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/weil.2.copy2.png" alt="" /></span><strong>People</strong> living in the industrial and capitalistic world are exposed to stress caused by numerous stimulants, the smallest examples of which include the technology advancement, mass media, communications, and domination of the culture of indolence. In the past decades, distraction has been discussed as the subject of intellectual ability (or the lack of it) within the framework of psychological or nervous system abnormalities. Besides, there are significant outcomes and effects of the shortage of cultural attention that must be investigated. However, distraction is not merely a simple intellectual problem for society but can be assumed as a spiritual and ethical problem as well. From this point of view, some thinkers believe that great social, ethical, and religious problems can be investigated and analyzed from the perspective of distraction and lack of attention. Therefore, addressing the issue of attention can solve any problems and guide humans toward a better life with serenity, which is lost in modern life and societies.</p>
      <p><strong>Attention</strong> is defined and investigated by several methods and approaches. In some approaches, attention is a perceptual phenomenon while, in other approaches, it is a phenomenon related to action. Attention is sometimes assumed as an intentional and voluntary phenomenon and sometimes is defined as completely independent of the individual's <em>will</em> so that the individual unintentionally notices the things that attract the most attention. The difficulty of presenting an integrated theory about attention, which applies true for voluntary, involuntary, perceptual, and active attention, makes the issue of attention one of the attractive philosophical subjects, which is gradually changed into a disputable issue in psychology whether at the neurological level or at the cognitive level.</p>
      <p>Another reason that makes attention an attractive philosophical and psychological subject is its relationship with <i>mysterious</i> phenomena. The experimental and theoretical considerations indicate that attention is closely related to the individual's <em>awareness</em> so that various arguments have been presented about this relationship, as an example of which the problem that whether the relationship of attention with awareness is of the <em>"necessity"</em> type or not can be mentioned. In addition, we see that it is sometimes claimed that an individual can, through attention, modify his conscious experiences, which seem to be important, during his life. Furthermore, some research works on the tradition of the morality of virtue consider attention important in terms of ethics because there are at least some virtues that require the individual's proper attention and, as mentioned earlier, they believe that many of the ethical problems are rooted in the lack of attention.</p>
      <p>As such, the subject of attention has been broached in the works of some philosophers here and there and its importance has been pointed out. However, before the 19<sup>th</sup> century, which has been a vital period in the development of psychology, no serious disputable attempt has been made on the theorization for presenting a clear definition for it and demonstrating it. Apropos of theorizing attention, while some have considered it a complicated and mysterious thing, some others have viewed it as an evident issue and have attempted to alleviate its complexity. For example, one of the most outstanding works in this regard is a book by <i>William James</i> entitled <em>"The Principles of Psychology"</em> in which the writer states:</p>
        <dl>
          <dd><i>"Everyone knows what attention is"</i> (<a href="#ref_1">James, 1950: p.256</a>).</dd>
        </dl>
      <p>Although <i>James</i> alleviates the complexity of the role of attention in perceptual phenomena, he considers an important clarificatory role for attention that results in the emergence of behaviors in human beings. For instance, he claims that</p>
        <dl>
        <dd><em>"volition is nothing but attention"</em> (<a href="#ref_1">Ibid: p.424</a>).</dd>
        </dl>
      <p> Due to his attitude towards attention, he speaks of two processes that lead to attention.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, pointing to <i>Francis Herbert Bradley</i>'s approach, <i>James</i> attempts to compare his own attitude towards attention with <i>Bradley</i>'s attitude; since, <i>Bradley</i> advocates an attitude based on which attention is not among phenomena that we can or need to present an independent theory for it. <i>Bradley</i> doesn't mention many details about this issue and, even later, states that:</p>
       <dl>
         <dd><em>"Is there any special activity of attention?"</em> (<a href="#ref_2">Mole, 2017</a>).</dd>
       </dl>
        <p><i>Bradley</i> argues that the path of <i>James</i>' project, which identifies the constituent processes of an individual's attention, is wrong. He claims that we cannot identify the attention-specific processes because if the excitation of the function of the human mind or body is aimed at achievement of profit and its outcome is satisfactory for humans, then the result of all of those functions will be active attention and, otherwise, the individual will say that he hasn't had enough attention; therefor, <i>Bradley</i> argues that there is nothing as the process of attention (<a href="#ref_2">Ibid</a>).</p>
      <p>Although <i>Bradley</i> doesn't use <i>John Locke</i>'s terms, his position has many things in common with <i>John Locke</i>'s claim that attention is a thinking method. <i>Bradley</i>'s position, like <i>Locke</i>'s, is that what is important for attention is not the type of process, thus he believes that counting the processes (unlike James) for constructing a theory for attention is wrong. However, it must be noted that in the 19th century, the theories on attention got far from <i>Bradley</i>'s approach and mainly sought to construct an independent theory and present processes for attention. This approach continued in such a way that thinkers, besides finding a model and process for attention, searched for a way to find out the amount of attention. Therefore, the question was how much attention is needed for doing a certain work? In this regard, there were some groups, such as <em>behaviorists</em>, that seemed to neglect the issue of attention; nonetheless, as time passed, different argumentations and experiments showed that, in fact, no one knows what attention is and attention is not something that can be investigated in vitro and, even, it cannot be assumed among simple processes. Hence, attention wasn't considered a simple issue anymore and it was viewed as a <strong>mysterious</strong> thing.</p>
      <p>Although many psychologists, neuroscientists, and philosophers have talked about attention, the philosopher <strong>Simone Weil (1909-1943)</strong> , a contemporary social activist and mystic, has focused on attention more than any other philosopher and mystic. She believes that if attention is understood deeply, it can be clearly found out that it is an important problem with social and individual dimensions. <em>Simone Weil</em>'s thoughts on attention become unique where she expresses that attention is not merely a cognitive, scientific, or psychological issue but it has direct and extensive impacts on education, theology, and even politics. Through the existence that <em>Weil</em> gave to the concentrated and full-of-attention life, she could express <em>the art of loving</em> and <em>the art of being</em> in a special and different way. In demonstrating attention, <em>Simone Weil</em> was influenced by religions such as <i>Hinduism</i> and <i>Buddhism</i> or schools such as <i>Zen-Buddhism</i> and <i>Taoism</i> and, in particular, the philosophy of <i>Stoicism</i>. Among different mystical and religious schools, the Eastern religions have addressed the issue of attention more than others and attention is much more outstanding in these religions.</p>
      <p><strong>Simone Weil</strong> gradually accepted <i>Platonic Christianity</i> as the core of her religious thoughts and, as such, she clearly made use of Eastern philosophies, which she considered as complementary to and matching with the main characteristics of <i>Christianity</i>. Hence, such an influence can be clearly seen in the concept that she presents for attention. Nonetheless, besides such influences, what actually makes <em>Simone Weil</em>'s attitude very special is her distinct life in which the representation of attention is evident. The attention about which <em>Weil</em> speaks is not merely a philosophical theorization or a mystical approach but, instead, it is a <strong>lifestyle</strong>, either at the individual level or at the social-political level. According to <em>Weil</em>'s point of view, investigating the attention can have significant effects on changing the dominant education method in the new education system. In addition, attention has social justice in itself so that attention-based ethics can significantly improve society's attitude towards a better life. Furthermore, attention associated with constant awakening and presence of mind will lead to a proper self-knowledge at the individual level and will change the human attitude towards the world.</p>
