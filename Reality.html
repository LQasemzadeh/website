            <h3>Reality and Attention</h3>
            <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/reality%20copy.png" alt="" /></span><strong>Simone Weil</strong> always seeks reality and everywhere in her writings she talks about cues that familiarize the readers with it and lead them toward it. She recommends the readers of her works to get out of Plato's cave in order to find out the essence of reality, understand it, and reach it. Influenced by Plato, she assumed the world as a cave that one should get out of it and what waits for humans outside the cave is God, a God who is absent in the world of creation. Therefore, the absent God is the absolute reality; because, in Weil's viewpoint, the distinction between reality and imaginary things is immortality and perpetuity and since only God is pre-existent and eternal, He is the only instance (representation) of reality (<a href="#ref_1">Weil, 2002: p.220</a>).</p>
            <p>Based on what was mentioned about reality, anything that can link humans with even a touch of reality so that a ray of light can be radiated onto them is efficient and important in Simone Weil's point of view. As an instance, affliction and attention can be mentioned, both of which link humans with reality and are capable to detach humans from any imaginary and illusory thing (<a href="#ref_2">Finch, 2001: p.12</a>). To find out the high importance of attention in Weil's viewpoint, that is enough to know that she expresses such a statement about it:</p>
            <dl>
                <dd>
                    <i>"God is attention without distraction." </i> (<a href="#ref_3">Weil, 1970: p.141</a>)
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>If God is the unit reality, which is pure attention, humans, by ignoring an object, indeed deny its reality and, by paying attention to an object, indeed grant reality to it. Hence, she has adopted such an approach that:</p>
            <dl>
                <dd>
                    <i>"Attention is what seizes hold of reality, so that the greater the attention on the part of the mind, the greater the amount of real being in the object."</i> (<a href="#ref_4">Weil, 1956: p.527</a>)
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>Such attitude indicates that the attention paid by humans to other things indeed grants life to reality in some way.</p>
            <p>To this point, it was known that attention is indeed reality and there is no doubt about it because humans have confirmed it by paying attention to it. This approach can be viewed from two Kantian and Descartesian positions. Rene Descartes, in his book <em>"Meditations on First Philosophy"</em>, concludes about meditation that every thing can be doubted while this is in contrast to the claim broached in the third meditation in which he tries to prove God and states that the clear and distinct ideas are beyond doubt. To resolve this contradiction in responding to the 7th group of objections, he states that when a human focuses his attention on clear and distinct ideas, these ideas won't be doubted. In other words, when we pay attention to a reality, we will clearly find out that we cannot doubt about it (<a href="#ref_5">Mole, 2017</a>).</p>
            <p>In addition, he is one of the philosophers who approve the mind, Weil embraces a Kantian position that mind is what orders reality since reality has no intrinsic order in itself:</p>

            <!-- Blockquote -->
            <blockquote>"The necessary connections that constitute the very reality of the world have no reality in themselves except as the object of intellectual attention in action […]. This virtue of intellectual attention makes it an image of the Wisdom of God. God creates by the act of thinking. We, by intellectual attention, do not indeed create, we produce no object, yet in our sphere we do in a certain way give birth to reality"(<a href="#ref_8">Weil, 1957: p.188</a>)</blockquote>
            <p>As can be inferred from these statements, a human doesn't create or make an object by paying attention, but his intellectual attention gives life to what actually exists and not paying attention to a real thing means the lack of life of that thing but it doesn’t mean that it doesn't exist at all. Therefore, it seems as if it is the mind that confirms the reality of an object through attention.</p>
            <p>If attention is indeed reality and reality is nothing but God, then it is the human that, as the subjective, gives life to an object by focusing his attention on it even if he is not the creator of it. Here, a notable point is that Simone Weil rejects any kind of ontology or even self-knowledge based on mere human-orientation. The problem with human-orientation is that an individual as a human forgets that he has limited power. Thus, according to Weil's belief, not all kinds of attention by humans give life to things but the attention must be pure and shouldn't be accompanied by impression. Impression is anything that comes from feeling, attachment, imagination, or affectability. In this regard, she states:</p>

            <!-- Blockquote -->
            <blockquote>"Attention, which is turned toward that which is able to be present without the help of attention is of a mixed kind; there is a mixture of attention and impression. Absolutely pure attention-attention which is nothing but attention-is attention directed toward God; for he is only present to the extent to which such attention exists." (<a href="#ref_4">Weil, 1956: p.527</a>)</blockquote>

            <p>If we consider such attention as embracing reality, then the subjective attitude will vanish because a human, to give life to something (that is reality), must turn away from himself and focus his attention on something else, which is God. Therefore, as Simone Weil believes that the absolute good is nothing but God, she believes that pure attention is also God and considers the ultimate attention in praying. So, the philosophy of praying is just this and nothing else.<p/>
            <dl>
                <dd>
                    <i>"Attitude of supplication: I must necessarily turn to something other than myself since it is a question of being delivered from self."</i> (<a href="#ref_6">Weil, 2003: p.3</a>)
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>As such, in intellectual attention, the mind is focused on something other than the <b>self</b>.</p>
            <p>When Weil assumes attention as embracing reality, so attention, like reality, has different levels and degrees. Accordingly the less the amount of attention, the less it realness. Since further attention is considered an "orientation" rather than a "status" in Simone Weil's attitude (<a href="#ref_4">Rozelle-Stone, 2020</a>), a low level of attention means a change in the orientation toward imaginary and illusory things, the origin of which is nothing but attachment. In such conditions, a human has focused his view onto something other than reality and, in such a case, the human will begin to value something that has no real existence, i.e. the <b>self</b>. The instinct of protecting the <b>self</b> makes the human to feel that such a continuance is a necessity and consider it his right but we are like that beggar man who said to Talleyrand, <em>"Sir, I must live"</em> and Talleyrand answered, <em>"I do not see necessity for that"</em> (<a href="#ref_7">Weil, 1951: p.224</a>). As mentioned earlier, the necessary connections that constitute the world have no reality in themselves except as the object of attention in action. Now, if a human has the lowest degree of attention, he will appreciate an illusory object by incorrect orientation instead of reality.</p>
