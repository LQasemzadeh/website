										<p>I, <strong>Zahra</strong> (<strong>Ladan</strong>) <strong>Qasemzadeh</strong>, have a bachelor's degree in <i>English translation</i> and a master's degree in <i>Islamic philosophy</i>.
											After spending a semester in Islamic philosophy, I realized that I am more interested in Western philosophers and thinkers than Islamic philosophers such as <em>Mulla Sadra</em> and <em>Ibn Sina</em>.
											It was during this time that through my supervisor, I met one of the professors of the math department named <em>Dr.Momtahan</em>, who was very interested in Simone Weil's thoughts and had been studying her books for years.
											After this acquaintance, Dr.Momtahan taught me <i>Gravity and Grace</i> by Simone Weil during my studies at the university.</p>

										<p><strong>Simone Weil (1909-1943)</strong>  was a French philosopher, mystic, and political activist. Describing by Albert Camus as <i>"the only great spirit of our times"</i>, Weil took a path that was unusual among twentieth-century intellectuals, in that she became more religious and inclined towards mysticism as her life progressed. Her works did not attract much attention until after her death, but in the 1950s and 1960s it became famous across continental Europe and the English-speaking world, and continues to be the subject of extensive scholarship across a wide range of field today.</p>
									<p>At the beginning, I realized Simone Weil with her late works i.e. religious and supernatural thought. Unfortunately, not all of her religious beliefs are acceptable to me. Over time, her social-political thoughts and her approach to the philosophy of mind and language attracted me more. Finally, I defended my Master’s thesis with the title of <strong>Impersonality on Thought of Simone Weil: Factors to arrive on it (with emphasis on attention) and its Effects</strong> with a score of 20 out of 20. During my studies, I wrote an English research article with the cooperation of my supervisor about <i>Sadra's philosophy</i>. Also, I wrote five research articles in Farsi from my thesis, four of them were published and one of the articles is waiting for publication. You can download them on <a href="generic.html">Published</a> section. Then, I graduated as a distinguished student with a GPA of 19.25 out of 20.</p>
									<p>Now, I work in an IT company as a <i>graphic designer</i> and <i>programmer</i> which is not related to my educational skills. Yet, it doesn’t mean that I am far from my educational skills that is really significant for me in my life. In my opinion, The best way to see things differently to other people is studying philosophy. We think our perceptions of the world are only biological and electrical reports. More than the physical reality of photons or sound waves, perception is a product of the brain and philosophy can help us to consolidate this product. So, philosophical thinking is an asset as well as high technological skills in this modern world. This is why philosophy has always been my first choice. </p>
										<p><strong>My research interests</strong> lie at the intersection of philosophy of mind, language and action, artificial intelligence, metaphysics, and ethics. The digital world and its relationship with humans are exciting topics for me, and I believe that Simone Weil has a lot to say about this. </p>
