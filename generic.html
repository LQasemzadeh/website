							<p>
								<strong>Abstract</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Decreation is one of the central ideas in Simone Weil’s mysticism that first was introduced by her into theological
								and mystical discourse of Christianity. Understanding the idea of decreation depends on understanding Weil’s model
								of creation. She believed that God, out of love, withdraws from His divinity so that the world of creation to be realized.
								Just as, in creation, God empties Himself of His divinity in order for man and the world to exist, so in decreation,
								man, by imitating God, also must empty himself of what have been given to him so that he can participate in creation
								as God wills. Decreation isn’t just imitating God detaching Himself from His divinity; rather, it is a passive action which,
								in practice, must be waited for after giving all the attachments and fantasies up. Simone Weil, through the act of decreation,
								explains how to deny selfishness and avoid egoism.

							<p>
								<strong>Abstract</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								The world has always been subject to a destructive evil, and every human being has experienced suffering in
								some way in his/her life. Therefore, if we do not look at evil with the connivance, we can find that the study
								of human suffering can constitute a part of the human's answers about evil. By propounding affliction,
								Simon Weil not only tries to answer some questions about evil, but also introduces the human to his other
								dimensions through affliction, as she introduces it as a step towards self-knowledge. For the self-alienated
								human of the modern world, the answer to causes of affliction is a liberating gift due to his return to his
								true self, because what truly liberates the human is the understanding of truth, and affliction helps him to
								achieve it. Therefore, in this article, the issue of affliction in the thought of this French scholar is
								examined in a descriptive-analytical manner by referring to Simone Weil's main works and those of her commentators.

							<p>
								<strong>Abstract</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Mullā Ṣadrā (d. 1050/1640) is the first Muslim philosopher to have discussed the death of angels.
								Ṣadrā's philosophy is influenced by the Qur'an and Hadith, and the mystics preceding him. Without a precise
								understanding of the Major Resurrection, it would be impossible to analyse the concept of the 'death of
								angels' in Ṣadrā's work. He analyses the nature of the Major Resurrection through mystical fundamentals,
								on the basis of which he considers the 'death of angels' to be justifiable. He has elaborated on how the
								death of angels can occur from two perspectives: Firstly, with the annihilation of God's Names, which
								occurs through the manifestation of God's essence at the time of the Major Resurrection. In this analysis,
								the idea of which was presented by Dāwūd al-Qayṣarī (d. 751/1350), the angels are also annihilated (in God)
								upon the manifestation of God's essence at the time of the Major Resurrection. Secondly,
								'the swooning death' (i.e., death by first falling into an unconscious state), which represents the
								return to the non-existence within the divine essence. This type of death occurs at the time of the Major
								Resurrection and Ṣadrā has in various instances considered it to include the angels. The second explanation is Ṣadrā's invention.
